## Editor & Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my code editor of choice. I was a die-hard [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com/) fan before and even bought a license with my own money. So suffice to say I went kicking and screaming over to VS Code, but honestly I can't imagine going back.
  - [Cobalt2 Workspace Theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode) has been my theme of choice for a few years now. I try to switch to new ones from time to time, but this one has been a staple for me because of how many scenarios it accounts for.
  - [Settings Sync Gist](https://gist.github.com/Akkireddy/49f33096bedcb0ab0b088232104a546b) for those who are wondering what extensions I'm running. I would be happy to write a post on essential extensions if people are interested.
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) is my terminal of choice for now, but I have been eyeing [hyper](https://hyper.is/) for some time as well.
  - [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) with [powerlevel9k theme](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k) is what I use instead of bash since the overall experience is more enjoyable for me in the terminal and makes everything visually pleasing to look at
- [Operator Mono](http://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/) is my font of choice. And yes, I was crazy enough to pay \$200 for it. My basic rationale was that this is something that I will be staring at for hours on end and why
